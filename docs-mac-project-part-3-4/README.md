# Documents Task 03 Part 3 & 4: Sectioning And Image Tool Skills

## Macintosh Version

### 3.13: To choose from a list of different section breaks, you can use the menu even if you are not on the layout tab.(You can click the breaks button on the layout tab if you prefer.) 

Stick with 

* Section Break (next page)  or the
* Section Break (odd page) odd pag breaks. 

Which ever you choose, stay with that choice for the entire project. 

Insert appropriate section breaks so that each separate element of the work (preface, chapters, endnotes, if any) starts on new page. (Use your document map and your keyboard shortcuts to speed the process).

### 3.14 and 3:15: Prepare for Table of Contents

If your downloaded book has a table of contents included in it, delete it because you will replace it with a new Table of Contents. 

After the title page and prior to the first section of the book, add a section break that will make the following page start on new page between the title page and the first chapter and put the words ""Table of Contents"" formatted as a heading 3 atop this page.

### 3.16, 3.17 and 3.18: Image Wrap and Layout Options

After you place your author image, you can right click on the photo and access the page wrap setting. To get to all of the layout settings, click ```More Layout Options...``` at the bottom of the fly-out panel.

### Clicking The More Layout Options will open the Advanced Layout  panel giving you access to ```position```, ```Text Wrapping``` and ```Size``` options.

Use this for setting the position and alignment for your author image and your logo image.

### 3.19: Mac Version of Word does not have a Drawing Canvas

The Windows Version requires the drawing canvas to group an imported image and a Word generated shape.

### 3.19: How to group an image and a shape in MS Word on the Mac without a Drawing Canvas:

Just make a logo out of shapes. 

Or you can do the following. (I don't expect you to do this. It's very difficult.) But if you want to group your shapes with an image, I got this to work:

<blockquote>Click into the text and insert a picture. Set the wrapping behind text so that the text will flow over the photo, otherwise a shape will not stay on top of the image. Then return a lot of blank lines so that the text will move off of the top of the Image. Now get your shape and put it on top of the image. Don't try to group it now, because if you do, your shape will disappear behind the back of the image. (Even though the shape looks like it's on top, _it's not really???_ hmmm.) So bring it to the front. Now you can group it. Drag your image back where you want it, and  set the wrap the way you want it and then delete all the hard returns you put in.</blockquote>
