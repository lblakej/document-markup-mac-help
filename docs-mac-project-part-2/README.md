### 1. Screen shots so you can create All Your Styles

Start with the Home tab<!----> and open the ```Styles Pane``` and then choose ```New Style``` for your ```Task03Content``` Style. If you choose the modify normal, then you will not be able to name the style as you wish. After the new style is created, you can modify it later, if necessary, by clicking on the Style and then choosing ```Modify Style...```

### 4. To Apply all your Heading 2 styles (and Heading 1 if you have Numbers and Titles) you will need your document map to show. 

**There is no  direct way to find and show your document map on the Mac Version of Word!**

Here is the workaround: Put your cursor in the first page and press ```control``` + ```H```. This will launch the left side panel which will let you click the document map tab:
