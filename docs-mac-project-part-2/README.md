# Documents Task 03 Part 2: Style Control Skills

## Macintosh Version

### 1. Screen shots so you can create All Your Styles

Start with the Home tab<!----> and open the ```Styles Pane``` and then choose ```New Style``` for your ```Task03Content``` Style. If you choose the modify normal, then you will not be able to name the style as you wish. After the new style is created, you can modify it later, if necessary, by clicking on the Style and then choosing ```Modify Style...```

To make more style changes, click ```Format``` and ```Paragraph``` (just above)


### 3. This allows you to make the rest of your Style Changes

A student told me there is a way to choose auto, but if you don't know how to do it, or forgot how to do it, just type it in as directed in the screen shot.

### 4. To Apply all your Heading 2 styles (and Heading 1 if you have Numbers and Titles) you will need your document map to show. 

The quickest way to get the document map up: Put your cursor in the first page and press ```control``` + ```H```. This will launch the left side panel which will let you click the document map tab:
